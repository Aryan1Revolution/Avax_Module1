In this Smart Contract, I chooses the theme of MCU ( where Tony Stark wants fund for devices development ) and give the extra functionality that every avengers should give the proposal and also give votes to a particular proposal.

Steps to test the Contract:
1. Before development make the address array to store avengers address.
2. Then deploy the contract while choosing the Tony stark address.
3. Now we choose any account from the avengers and give the proposal and then give the vote.
4. Then change the address to the second avengers either give proposal or vote for a particular proposal.
5. Now again move to Tony stark address and final the one proposal with maximum no. of votes.
